        <p class="breckp">
            In the winter, it's a bit more difficult to visit some of the regular tourist attractions because of the multiple 
            feet of snow that Colorado receives every winter. But because of all that snow, Colorado also has some world-renowned
            ski resorts. Breckenridge and Vail are a couple of the best ski resorts in the state, and aren't too far from Denver if 
            you're looking for somewhere close to the city. To the far south, there's Telluride ski resort with runs perfect for 
            beginners and experts alike.

        <p class="steamp">
            A bit further North-West of Denver you can find the town of Steamboat Springs, with their own ski resort and a hot 
            springs pool to warm yourself up at the end of the day. And while Steamboat Springs' hot springs are hard to beat, 
            most every resort has a town worth exploring at the base of the mountains after a cold day on the slopes. These towns 
            are a great place to find equipment, souvenirs, or local dining options too.
