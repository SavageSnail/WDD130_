      <h3>Home page/ Hiking</h3>
      <p>
        Colorado is a beautiful state all year round. However, some of the greatest parts of CO are the most enjoyable in the 
        warmer months of the year. There are many gorgeous places to hike, walk around, or even just drive through and enjoy the nature
        around you. Garden of the Gods provides a breathtaking view of massive red-rock structures, and makes for a
        pleasant, short hike. There is also a road conveniently wrapping around the landmark, allowing for faster and easier visits if 
        it's a bit too hot to be outside. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Stretching up and down most of the west half of the state are the Rocky Mountains. There are countless scenic areas to hike 
        throughout the mountains, and multiple national parks in the mountains with visitor centers informing tourists of the best 
        places to check out. The crystal clear waters of Hanging Lake Park deep in the mountains is one of the many hidden gems of 
        the Rockies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mesa Verde national park is a must-see park located in the south-west corner of the state, further away from the 
        major cities. The park boasts incredible Ancestral Native American communities carved into the stone cliffs and 
        mesas around the park. Mesa Verde gives visitors an unique look at the heritage of 26 pueblos and tribes.

    </ul>
    <h3>Skii Resorts</h3>
    <p>
        In the winter, it's a bit more difficult to visit some of the regular tourist attractions because of the multiple 
        feet of snow that Colorado receives every winter. But because of all that snow, Colorado also has some world-renowned
        ski resorts. Breckenridge and Vail are a couple of the best ski resorts in the state, and aren't too far from Denver if 
        you're looking for somewhere close to the city. To the far south, there's Telluride ski resort with runs perfect for 
        beginners and experts alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bit further North-West of Denver you can find the town of Steamboat Springs, with their own ski resort and a hot 
        springs pool to warm yourself up at the end of the day. And while Steamboat Springs' hot springs are hard to beat, 
        most every resort has a town worth exploring at the base of the mountains after a cold day on the slopes. These towns 
        are a great place to find equipment, souvenirs, or local dining options too.

    <h3>Indoor Attractions</h3>
      <p>
        For the outdoorsy type of people, Colorado is a dream come true. That's not to say, however, that there isn't plenty 
        of fun things to do indoors as well. In Denver, there's the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. The museum is 716,000 
        square feet, and has many award-winning exhibits of gemstones, mummies, dinosaur fossils, and multiple exhibits for
        local and foreign wildlife. There's also a “Space Odyssey” section, presenting all sorts of interesting exhibits about 
        the universe around us and has on display a life-size replica of a Mars Exploration Rover. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In Estes Park (between Fort Collins and Boulder) there's the Stanley Hotel, famous for its spooky reputation as the 
        inspiration for the novel and film adaptation of “The Shining” by Stephen King. The hotel features a daytime tour for 
        history buffs, and a nighttime tour for fanatics of the paranormal. If neither of those options interest you, the town 
        of Estes Park below has plenty of local shops and other, more cozy places to stay. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A fascinating place to visit that's out of the elements but isn't much warmer is Cave of the Winds, near Manitou Springs. 
        At a near constant 54 degrees, this massive underground cave formation boasts thousands upon thousands of stalactites
        and stalagmites as well as a plethora of other rare natural formations that appear to defy gravity. There are walking 
        tours of the caves that range from 30-45 minutes to over 2 1/2 hours.
