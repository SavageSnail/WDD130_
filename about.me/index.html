    <h2>Peyton Bledsoe</h2>
    <p>Although commonly mistaken for the handsome fella on the right, 
        I'm actually the one in the middle of the pic above!</p>
        <p>On the left is my beautiful wife that I've been happily married to for 2 years now,
            and on the right is our recently adopted goof ball, Lucky.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite hobbies include playing trading card games, video games, long boarding, 
            snowboarding, and spending quality time with friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a software engineering major with the hopes of someday becoming really good at engineering software 
            to start a career in that field. Although, I'm still not sure where exactly I want to specialize in. 
            But I love everything I've done so far with coding and really look forward to taking this class with y'all!
        </p>
